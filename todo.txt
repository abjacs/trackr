We assume a router MAC corresponds to a location which we roughly categorize as home, work, other

if(new router mac)
	query user to determine work, home, etc.

periodically, on 10min interval, query router mac to determine if we're still at same "location"

Also-
	handle computer idle time
	handle computer resume from idle
	(subtract these times from our logged times to be more accurate)
